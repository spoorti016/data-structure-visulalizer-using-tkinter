2. Problem Statement:  
To implement a data structure visualizer (for searching and sorting) 
3. Keywords:  
Tkinter: The tkinter package (“Tk interface”) is the standard Python  interface to the Tcl/Tk GUI toolkit. 
  
Canvas: The Canvas widget lets us display various graphics on the  application. It can be used to draw simple shapes to complicated graphs.  We can also display various kinds of custom widgets according to our  needs. 
  
Grid: The Grid geometry manager puts the widgets in a 2-dimensional  table. The master widget is split into a number of rows and columns, and  each “cell” in the resulting table can hold a widget. 
  
Labels: Tkinter Label is a widget that is used to implement display boxes  where you can place text or images. 
Entry box: The Entry Widget is a Tkinter Widget used to Enter or display a  single line of text. 
Time module: Python time module allows to work with time in Python. It  allows functionality like getting the current time, pausing the Program  from executing, etc. 
4. Abstract: 
Data Structures and Algorithms is a fundamental course in Computer  Science. However, many students find it difficult because it requires  abstract thinking. It would be very helpful if there was a visualization tool 
of data structures such as searching and sorting for students to  manipulate. The tool would allow students to see how elements are  searched and sorted,etc. This project is intended to create an  exploration environment, in which students can learn through  experimentation. This tool can be used as an effective supplement to the  traditional classroom education and textbook for Data Structures and  Algorithms courses. In this paper, a software application that features  the visualization of commonly used searching and sorting methods in  data structures is introduced. 
5. Module wise description:  
Tkinter:  
Tkinter is the standard GUI library for Python. Python when combined  with Tkinter provides a fast and easy way to create GUI applications.  Tkinter provides a powerful object-oriented interface to the Tk GUI  toolkit. 
Creating a GUI application using Tkinter is an easy task. All you need to  do is perform the following steps − 
1. Import the Tkinter module. 
2. Create the GUI application main window. 
3. Add one or more of the above-mentioned widgets to the GUI  application. 
4. Enter the main event loop to take action against each event triggered by  the user. 
Time:  
The Python time module provides many ways of representing time in  code, such as objects, numbers, and strings. It also provides functionality  other than representing time, like waiting during code execution and  measuring the efficiency of your code. The time.sleep() method provides  time-lapse or delay between the execution of the current processes or  threads. 
Random: Python Random module is an in-built module of Python which  is used to generate random numbers. These are pseudo-random  numbers means these are not truly random. This module can be used to 
perform random actions such as generating random numbers, print  random a value for a list or string, etc. 
  
6.Technology selected and technology features covered:  
A graphical user interface (GUI) is an interface through which a user  interacts with electronic devices such as computers and smartphones  through the use of icons, menus and other visual indicators or  representations (graphics). GUIs graphically display information and  related user controls, unlike text-based interfaces, where data and  commands are strictly in text. GUI representations are manipulated  by a pointing device such as a mouse, trackball, stylus, or by a finger  on a touch screen.
